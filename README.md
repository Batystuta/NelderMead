# NelderMead
A Generic Nelder Mead optimization function for the parameter optimization of any predictive algorithms that is or can be integrated with R.


For a brief overview of the algorithm's origins and the function, please refer to the following document
 * [document.pdf](https://github.com/krenova/NelderMead/blob/master/document.pdf)
 * to note that the document is slightly outdated and may not reflect all the current function's iterations
 * for the updated function arguments, please refer to the code itself: [NelderMead.R](https://github.com/krenova/NelderMead/blob/master/lib/NelderMead.R)


Before attempting to use the function, going through either the following examples is highly recommended:
 * to quickly jump into the use of the library, please refer to: [example.ipynb](https://github.com/krenova/NelderMead/blob/master/example.ipynb)
 * to run the programme in R instead of Jupyter Notebook, please refer to: [example.R](https://github.com/krenova/NelderMead/blob/master/example.R)
