# NelderMead

A Generic Nelder Mead optimization function, _**NM_opt()**_, for the parameter optimization of any predictive algorithms that is or can be integrated with R. This means that unlike for example, R's **caret** grid search function, the algorithm of choice does not need to be integrated or recognized by **caret** but as long as the algorithm can run in R,   _**NM_opt()**_, can be used to find the algorithm's local optimal parameters. The extent of this means that even python algorithms can be optimized using  _**NM_opt()**_. However, in exchange for this flexibility,  _**NM_opt()**_ is not easy to use and will require sometime to understand how the function is built and how it can be fully exploited.


1. [NelderMead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method) is a heuristic unconstrained optimization algorithm that is loosely speaking, based around the construction of a simplex (the simplest plane that be constructed in higher dimensions), that is used to get a sense of the optimization surface. Based on some logical rules, this simplex will then 'feel' and work its way towards a local minima/maxima.


2. To note that because NelderMead is an unconstrained optimization algorithm, mapping and inverse mapping of parameters that are constrained will be required. For example, parameters restricted to lie in the range (0, +inf) will need a log transformation to map the range to the values (-inf, inf).
